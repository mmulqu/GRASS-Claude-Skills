# i.maxlik

**Category**: imagery

## Description

Classifies the cell spectral reflectances in imagery data. Classification is based on the spectral signature information generated by either i.cluster, g.gui.iclass, or i.gensig.

## grass.tools API (Recommended for new code)

⚠️ **Status**: Experimental in GRASS 8.5, will be stable in 8.6

### Function Signature

```python
tools.i_maxlik(group,subgroup,signaturefile,output,reject=None,overwrite=None,verbose=None,quiet=None,superquiet=None)
```

### Parameters

1. **`group : str, required`**
   - Name of input imagery group
   - Used as: input, group, name

2. **`subgroup : str, required`**
   - Name of input imagery subgroup
   - Used as: input, subgroup, name

3. **`signaturefile : str, required`**
   - Name of input file containing signatures
   - Generated by either i.cluster, g.gui.iclass, or i.gensig
   - Used as: input, sigfile, name

4. **`output : str | type(np.ndarray) | type(np.array) | type(gs.array.array), required`**
   - Name for output raster map holding classification results
   - Used as: output, raster, name

5. **`reject : str | type(np.ndarray) | type(np.array) | type(gs.array.array), optional`**
   - Name for output raster map holding reject threshold results
   - Used as: output, raster, name

6. **`overwrite : bool, optional`**
   - Allow output files to overwrite existing files
   - Default: None

7. **`verbose : bool, optional`**
   - Verbose module output
   - Default: None

8. **`quiet : bool, optional`**
   - Quiet module output
   - Default: None

9. **`superquiet : bool, optional`**
   - Very quiet module output
   - Default: None

### Returns

result : grass.tools.support.ToolResult | np.ndarray | tuple[np.ndarray] | None
If the tool produces text as standard output, a ToolResult object will be returned. Otherwise, None will be returned. If an array type (e.g., np.ndarray) is used for one of the raster outputs, the result will be an array and will have the shape corresponding to the computational region. If an array type is used for more than one raster output, the result will be a tuple of arrays.

### Raises

grass.tools.ToolError: When the tool ended with an error.

## Detailed Description

i.maxlik is a maximum-likelihood discriminant analysis classifier. It
can be used to perform the second step in either an unsupervised or a
supervised image classification.

Either image classification methods are performed in two steps. The
first step in an unsupervised image classification is performed by i.cluster ; the first step in a supervised
classification is executed by the GRASS program g.gui.iclass (or by providing any other raster map
with already existing training areas). In both cases, the second step in
the image classification procedure is performed by i.maxlik .

In an unsupervised classification, the maximum-likelihood classifier
uses the cluster means and covariance matrices from the i.cluster signature file to determine to which
category (spectral class) each cell in the image has the highest
probability of belonging. In a supervised image classification, the
maximum-likelihood classifier uses the region means and covariance
matrices from the spectral signature file generated by g.gui.iclass , based on regions (groups of image
pixels) chosen by the user, to determine to which category each cell in
the image has the highest probability of belonging.

In either case, the raster map output by i.maxlik is a classified
image in which each cell has been assigned to a spectral class (i.e., a
category). The spectral classes (categories) can be related to specific
land cover types on the ground.
