# g.gui.iclass

**Category**: general

## Description

Tool for supervised classification of imagery data. Generates spectral signatures for an image by allowing the user to outline regions of interest.

## grass.tools API (Recommended for new code)

⚠️ **Status**: Experimental in GRASS 8.5, will be stable in 8.6

### Function Signature

```python
tools.g_gui_iclass(group=None,subgroup=None,map=None,trainingmap=None,flags=None,verbose=None,quiet=None,superquiet=None)
```

### Parameters

1. **`group : str, optional`**
   - Name of input imagery group
   - Used as: input, group, name

2. **`subgroup : str, optional`**
   - Name of input imagery subgroup
   - Used as: input, subgroup, name

3. **`map : str | np.ndarray, optional`**
   - Name of raster map to load
   - Used as: input, raster, name

4. **`trainingmap : str, optional`**
   - Ground truth training map to load
   - Used as: input, vector, name

5. **`flags : str, optional`**
   - Allowed values: m
   - m
   - Maximize window

6. **`verbose : bool, optional`**
   - Verbose module output
   - Default: None

7. **`quiet : bool, optional`**
   - Quiet module output
   - Default: None

8. **`superquiet : bool, optional`**
   - Very quiet module output
   - Default: None

### Returns

result : grass.tools.support.ToolResult | None
If the tool produces text as standard output, a ToolResult object will be returned. Otherwise, None will be returned.

### Raises

grass.tools.ToolError: When the tool ended with an error.

## Detailed Description

Supervised Classification Tool (wxIClass) is a wxGUI component which allows the user to create training areas and generate
spectral signatures. The resulting signature file can be used as input
for i.maxlik or as a seed signature file for i.cluster . WxIClass can be launched from the Layer
Manager menu Imagery → Classify image → Interactive input for
supervised classification or via command line as g.gui.iclass .

wxIClass currently allows you to:



wxIClass performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass supervised
image classification process; the GRASS module i.maxlik executes the second pass. Both programs must be run to generate a
classified map in GRASS raster format.

wxIClass is an interactive program that allows the user to create
multiple training areas for multiple classes and calculate the spectral
signatures based on the cells that are within the training areas. During
this process the user will be shown histograms for each image band. The
user can also display the cells of the image bands which fall within a
user-specified number of standard deviations from the means in the
spectral signature. By doing this, the user can see how much of the
image is likely to be put into the class associated with the signature.

wxIClass can also import training areas defined in a vector layer. In
that case the program expects the vector layer to have the following
columns defined:

The spectral signatures are composed of region means and covariance
matrices. These region means and covariance matrices are used in the
second pass ( i.maxlik ) to classify the image.

Alternatively, the spectral signatures generated by wxIClass can be
used for seed means for the clusters in i.cluster .
